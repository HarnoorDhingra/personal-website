**Fashion cursor (one of four subjects):**  
Put these images in this folder:

- **`subject.png`**
- **`subject2.png`**
- **`subject3.png`**
- **`subject4.png`**

When someone picks “fashion,” the cursor shows one of these at random. Use square or nearly square crops; they’re shown at cursor size. If a file is missing, the cursor falls back to a pink circle.
